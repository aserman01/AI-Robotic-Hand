# AI Controlled Robotic Hand

This project is for a robotic hand controlled by AI for FRDM-KL25Z Microcontroller. Hand mimmicks the user's finger gestures through a camera. It has 5 different states (fully closed, %25, %50, %75, fully open) for each finger individually and number of states could be increased with more optimization easily.

Before starting, many thanks to my project partner Busenaz Kerimgil. This project is her work as well as mine. 

## Getting Started

These two files would be enough for you to get this project working after initializing basic files for KL25Z MC. I also used an Ardunio Nano to make serial communications easier and more traceable, however it is not necessery. 

I 3D-Printed this hand from InMoov: https://inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/ (Gael Langevin has a great tutorial about it and he is building a full robotic body himself!)
