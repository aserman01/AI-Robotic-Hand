# AI Controlled Robotic Hand

This project is for a robotic hand controlled by AI for FRDM-KL25Z Microcontroller. Hand mimmicks the user's finger gestures through a camera. It has 5 different states (fully closed, %25, %50, %75, fully open) for each finger individually and number of states could be increased with more optimization easily.

Before starting, many thanks to my project partner Busenaz Kerimgil. This project is her work as well as mine. 

## Getting Started

These two files would be enough for you to get this project working after initializing basic files for KL25Z MC. I also used an Ardunio Nano to make serial communications easier and more traceable, however it is not necessery. 

I 3D-Printed this hand from InMoov: https://inmoov.fr/hand-and-forarm/ (Gael Langevin has a great tutorial about it and he is building a full robotic body himself!)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
